TODO:
- write such tests that proove that it's working (play itself)
- don't evaluate leafs - instead evaluate what's not evaluated

IDEAS:
- memory usage as command line argument
- remove Board from Position, use parent for this
- add forward reference for best next move from given position
- add cache of board hashes that maps Board-Hash <-> [Parents]
- neural network evaluator that has bitbords of {Color, Piece} on input
